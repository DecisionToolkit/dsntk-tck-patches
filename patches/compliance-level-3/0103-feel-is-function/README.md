# 0103-feel-is-function

This patch changes the time offset in test in file **0103-feel-is-function**.
This test is valid only during summer in Melbourne. The logic of this test should be adjusted
to pass also when this test is run by someone sitting in the cafe in Melbourne in warm winter afternoon.
